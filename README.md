# GIF-Search-Engine

Project for CS 6200: Information Retrieval
---

Although information retrieval systems perform well on many tasks, there is still plenty of room for new systems and applications. In this project, we attempt to create a search engine that would retrieve GIFs with queries on description of the GIF, dialogues, captions, and so on. A user would type in a query and would expect a GIF related to that query. That is what the search engine would aim to do.
